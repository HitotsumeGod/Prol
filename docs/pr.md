PR is Prol's scripting language, and is the only way to interface with its bots. PR is composed of commands (basically functions), control flow logic, and dynamically-typed variables. Its commands function in such a way that they may be passed to Prol in a manner visually identical to ordinary command line argument passing, but under the hood, they are being processed in the same way as any PR script.
